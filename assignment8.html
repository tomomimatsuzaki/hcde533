            <h2>Propagation Station</h2>
            <p>One of my ideas for the final project was to create something for plants, but I wanted to make something more intricate than just a plant pot. During my brainstorming session, I came across some images of plant propagation and thought it would be a great idea to create a propagation station. My propagation station is going to be a tool that allow users to propagate many plants at the same time. See the inspo and my sketchese below for more details.</p>
            
            <h2>Inspo</h2>

            <div class="space-block"></div>
        
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a8-perspective.png">
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>The design of the propagation station would look like stairs. Each little plate that hold test tubes will be a flower petal shape and I'm going to lazer cut a acrylic sheet to create this shape. There will be around 5-6 petals and each petal holds one test tube. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
            <img src="images/a8-topbottom.png">
                <h3>Top & bottom</h3>
                <p>When you see this propagation station from the top, it will look like a flower. The shape of the base is also going to be a flower shape. I will create this base with 3D printer.</p>

            <div class="step">

                <h3>Find the right angle</h3>
                <p>I used the command Draft Angle Analysis to see the balance of the opject. It looked already looked well-balanced as I see blue in the top half and red in the bottom half of the object. I also rotate it by 90 degrees, but the color balance was not as good as the original one.</p>
