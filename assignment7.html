            <h2>Instruction</h2>
            <p>Design and fabricate a 2-part (silicone) mold.   You will need to use the mold to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster). Design your master part in CAD first, then design your mold, then design a mold to cast your mold in. So meta! You need to 3d print your molds-for-molds. Then you need to cast your molds! Then you need to cast your parts! </p>
            
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Rhino, Cura, Ender 3D Pro, Oomoo, Hydro Stone</p>

                <img src="images/a6-pumpkin.png">
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>For this assignment I wanted to create a shape of produce and I found these cute pumpkins on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1836056" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-objecttype.png">
                <h3>Reduce Mesh</h3>
                <p>Once I opened the STL file I realized it was an open mesh object. I used the command ReduceMesh and reduced mesh by 50% twice. The object type turned to closed mesh.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-balance.png">
                <h3>Find the right angle</h3>
                <p>I used the command Draft Angle Analysis to see the balance of the opject. It looked already looked well-balanced as I see blue in the top half and red in the bottom half of the object. I also rotate it by 90 degrees, but the color balance was not as good as the original one.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-vent.png">
                <h3>Sprue & Vent</h3>
                <p>The first think I did was to add a sprue (main intake vent) and another thin vent to allow air to come out while poring a plaster.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-registration.png">
                <h3>Registration points</h3>
                <p>Using the command Sphere, I added some registration points to avoid the two molds from sliding.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-split-objects.png">
                <h3>Split objects</h3>
                <p>Next step is to split these objects, vents, and registration points into half to create a mold-of-mold.<br>
                1. Used the rectangle surface to split the objects.<br>
                2. Used the command MeshBooleanSplit to split the pumpkin, but something went wrong and the pumpkin disappeared.<br>
                3. I realized the rectangle surface was not covering the entire part of the vents, which was the reason MeshBooleanSplit was not working.<br>
                4. After fixing this error, I was able to split all objects successfully.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-cap.png">
                <h3>Close the objects</h3>
                <p>One thing that I often forget is to make sure objects are closed, which causes a problem when combining two objects. The mesh opject was already closed, so I capped all the half spheres.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-box.png">
                <h3>Add a box</h3>
                <p>I created a box that fits the objects, vents, registration points nicely for both top and bottom. I realized the registration points needed to be flipped for one side, so I fixed it later as well. </p>
                <p> I also encountered a problem when combining the box and the pumpkin. I turned the box and spheres into mesh, but still MeshBooleanUnion didn't work. I assume it was because only the surface of the pumpkin and the box was touching but crossing each other. I used the command Join instead, was able to combine them, and did not have a problem with printing with Cura either.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-moldofmold.png">
                <h3>Print molds</h3>
                <p>It took around 7 hours to print each side of the mold</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-mixoomoo.png">
                <h3>Mix Oomoo ingredients</h3>
                <p>Now, it's time to make sillicone molds with Oomoo. I used paper cups to measure the same amount of two ingredients (pink and blue) and mixed them together untill it gets completely mixed and purple color.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-oomoo.png">
                <h3>Pour Oomoo into the mold-of-mold</h3>
                <p>Pour this purple Oomoo into the mold-of-mold and let it sit over night (6  hours)</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-molds.png">
                <h3>Take the molds out</h3>
                <p>I used a very thin flat tool to take the molds out of the box. They looked great and fit perfectly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-hydrostone.png">
                <h3>Pour hydrostone into the mold</h3>
                <p>As I realized the pouring hole was too small, I used a utility knife and cut the opening a little. Slowly added water into hydrostone while mixing until the texture looks like yogurt, poured it into the mold. Once it's filled up, I tilted the mold and slightly pressed it with my fingers to let the remaining air come out. For the first try, hydrostone was too loose and it took about 50 mins to let it completely dry. Later, I made it thicker and it only took 20-25 mins.</p>

                <img src="images/a6-finallook.png">
                <h3>Final look</h3>
                <p>Hydrostone didn't go all the way to the end of the pumpkin stems. Stems were a little short but still they all looked great:)</p>
