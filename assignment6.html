            <h2>Instruction</h2>
            <p>Please make a lamp! Using your lamp innereds' measurements as a point of departure, make a lamp that can be assembled around the innereds out of 3D printed parts. You should be able to remove the lamp from the innereds again, so you cannot attach the lamp to the innereds with glue, fasteners, adhesive, etc.  Imagine your lamp being in a domestic setting---perhaps it will not be wildly shaken, but it should not fall apart with normal use. </p>

                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>During my brainstorming, I found these pictures of vases and lamps. I really like these simple and curvy designs and decided to create something similar.</p>

                <h3>Watch Tutorial Videos</h3>
                <p>Before moving forward, I wanted to make sure I’m able to make those shapes with Rhino. So I watched several tutorial videos on YouTube to learn about how to use Rhino and Grasshopper. As Grasshopper seemed pretty complicated, I decided to use only Rhino to create a 3D model using some commands that I learned from the videos.</p>

                <h3>Take Measurement 1</h3>
                <p>I measured each part of my lamp innards.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">

                <h3>Take Measurement 2</h3>
                <p>I also mearured it with a light bulb to make sure the lamp innards and a light bulb will be covered completely.</p>

                <h3>Sketching the idea</h3>
                <p>After measuring the lamp innards, I sketched out my ideas and decided on the lamp size. During this sketching session, I used Rhino sometimes to make sure that I am able to create the shape.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Framing</h3>
                <p>The first thing I did was to create a frame of the tower like the image. This helped me see the height, and width of the top/bottom openings easily while I’m designing the tower shape. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino2.png">
                <h3>Create a wavy circle</h3>
                <p>I first created a little circle and with the command ArrayPolar, Trim, and Join, I made this large wavy circle. This is the shape of the bottom part of the lamp.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino4.png">
                <h3>Create a wavy path</h3>
                <p>I used a command Curve and outlined the wavy path from the bottom to the top of the tower.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino6.png">
                <h3>Create a body</h3>
                <p>Using the command RailRevolve, I created this body shape - the wavy circle at the bottom traces the wavy path and create this surface.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino7.png">
                <h3>Twist a body</h3>
                <p>Using the command Twist, I twisted the body 45 degrees and added a shade on the surface as well.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino8.png">
                <h3>Give it a width</h3>
                <p>Using the command OffsetSrf, I added a 2 mm width to the surface.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-rhino9.png">
                <h3>Hook</h3>
                <p>As I noticed the lamp innards have little slots, I added these little hooks on the top opening so that the lamp will stay on the innards tight.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-lidprint.png">
                <h3>Test print</h3>
                <p>For the test print, I only needed to make sure the lamp sits on the innards nicely. I printed only the top part of the lamp and put it on the innards. It didn’t fit very tight, but I made sure it was balanced and didn’t tilt when I move it around. I could have scaled it down to make it fit perfectly, but I chose not to because I didn't want to make the body any smaller.</p>

                <img src="images/a6-print.png">
                <h3>Print</h3>
                <p>I converted the file to STL and exported it to Cura. I flipped the body to minimize the amount of support I use on Cura. It took around 16 hours to print the entire body. <br>(4. Taking the support off the body by making sure I don’t break the body.)</p>

                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>For this assignment I wanted to create a shape of produce and I found these cute pumpkins on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1836056" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-objecttype.png">
                <h3>Reduce Mesh</h3>
                <p>Once I opened the STL file I realized it was an open mesh object. I used the command ReduceMesh and reduced mesh by 50% twice. The object type turned to closed mesh.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-balance.png">
                <h3>Find the right angle</h3>
                <p>I used the command Draft Angle Analysis to see the balance of the opject. It looked already looked well-balanced as I see blue in the top half and red in the bottom half of the object. I also rotate it by 90 degrees, but the color balance was not as good as the original one.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-vent.png">
                <h3>Sprue & Vent</h3>
                <p>The first think I did was to add a sprue (main intake vent) and another thin vent to allow air to come out while poring a plaster.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-registration.png">
                <h3>Registration points</h3>
                <p>Using the command Sphere, I added some registration points.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-split-objects.png">
                <h3>Split objects</h3>
                <p>Next step is to split these objects, vents, and registration points into half to create a mold-of-mold.<br>
                1. Used the rectangle surface to split the objects.<br>
                2. Used the command MeshBooleanSplit to split the pumpkin, but something went wrong and the pumpkin disappeared.<br>
                3. I realized the rectangle surface was not covering the entire part of the vents, which was the reason MeshBooleanSplit was not working.<br>
                4. After fixing this error, I was able to split all objects successfully.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-cap.png">
                <h3>Close the objects</h3>
                <p>One thing that I often forget is to make sure objects are closed, which causes a problem when combining two objects. The mesh opject was already closed, so I capped all the half spheres.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a6-box.png">
                <h3>Add a box</h3>
                <p>I created a box that fit all the objects, vents, registration points nicely for both top and bottom objects. I realized the registration points needed to be flipped for one side, so I fixed it later as well. </p>
                <p> I also encounter a problem when combining the box and the pumpkin. I turned the box and spheres into mesh, but still MeshBooleanUnion didn't work. I assume it was because only the surface of the half pumpkin and box was touching. I used the command Join and was able to combine them all. Did not have problem with printing with Cura either.</p>
