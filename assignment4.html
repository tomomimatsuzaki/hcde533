            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The goal of this assignment is to assemble the 3D printer and conduct test prints with different settings.</p>
            
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Rhino, Cura, Ender 3D Pro</p>
            
            
            <h2>Process</h2>
            
            <img src="images/a3-assembly.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <p>First, I followed the instruction guide and assembled the 3D printer. I also watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Z3GmM20JM&t=1111s" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>, which gave me some tips to make this assembly process fo smoothly. </p>
            <p>1. Checked if the metal bar is straight<br>2. Checked if there is no space between each part<br>3. Tried the "Auto Home" to see it works properly and it didn't work at the beginning. I realized the belt was upside down, which was causing uneven movements.</p>
            
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a3-fail.jpg">
                <h3>First Test Print</h3>
                <p>I tried printing a cube with low quality. I was working fine at the beginning, but later it couldn't hold the shape and started making a spaghetti monster. Thinks that I tried to fix this problems are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slowered the speed from 50 mm to 40 mm</li>
                    <li>Adjusted the bed leveling</li>
                    <li>Kept the bed temperature higher</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a3-cubes.jpg">
                <h3>2cm Cubes Test Print</h3>
                <p>I was finally able to print cubes successfully. The low and standard quality took 24 and 26 mins, while super quality took 55 mins to print the same 2cm cubes. I only saw a slight difference between low and standard quality cubes, but the surface of a super quality cube was much smoother than the others.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left: low quality and a concentric top</li>
                    <li>Middle: standard quality and a concentric top</li>
                    <li>Right:super quality and line top</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-tubes.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Tubes</h3>
            <p>The next task was to create a tube 3cm diameter and 3cm high</p>
            <p>1. I made a single extrusion wall thickness (0.8mm) with Rhino.</p>
            <p>2. I made a double extrusion wall thickness (1.6mm)  with Rhino and set random z-seam alignment on Cura, which created this rough surface. <br>3. The double extrusion wall didn't stick together well - there was a space between the inner and outer layer. </p>
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-cylinder.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Cylinders</h3>
            <p>1. A cylinder 2cm in diameter exported with a 0.1mm tolerance (left) and 0.001mm tolerance (right) The one with 0.001mm tolerance looked better quality but there was no big difference between two. (35 mins for both)
            <br>
            2. I found there was a weird space between each layer. Would like to know how we can minimize these unwanted gaps.
            <br>
            3. A cylinder 2cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour". I don't know if was suppoed to look like this. (17 mins)
            
            </p>
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-support2.png" width=100%>
            <img src="images/a3-support.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Cylinder with support</h3>
            <p>I also created a cyinder 2cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on. I was able to see where it gets supports on Cura, wasn't sure if the support in the middle was necessary... The quality of cilynder was much better than the first 3 cylinders even though I used the same settings. (1 hour 37 mins)</p>
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-nested2.png" width=100%>
            <img src="images/a3-nested.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Nested Object</h3>
            <p>Lastly, I printed nested opbjects. The hardest part of it was to create a 3d model with Rhino - it took me a while for me to create a triangle wall but I figured it out by using a command "PlanarSrf" and "ExtrudeSrf." It took 2 hours and 34 mins to print with standard quality.</p>
