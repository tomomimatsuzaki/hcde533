            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The goals of this assignment is to design a box that is made up of flat panels with fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method design for sheet material. Panels and all tabs need to be 3d printed, but cannot 3D print the box in one piece. Design for an interference fit - when we press the panels together they should join tightly and not need additional fasteners and screws. Furthermore, they should provide a close enough fit that your resulting box can hold something like sugar without leaking. </p>
            
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Rhino, Cura, Ender 3D Pro</p>

                <h3>2cm Cubes Test Print</h3>
                <p>I was finally able to print cubes successfully. The low and standard quality took 24 and 26 mins, while super quality took 55 mins to print the same 2cm cubes. I only saw a slight difference between low and standard quality cubes, but the surface of a super quality cube was much smoother than the others.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left: low quality and a concentric top</li>
                    <li>Middle: standard quality and a concentric top</li>
                    <li>Right:super quality and line top</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-tubes.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Tubes</h3>
            <p>The next task was to create a tube 3cm diameter and 3cm high</p>
            <p>1. I made a single extrusion wall thickness (0.8mm) with Rhino.</p>
            <p>2. I made a double extrusion wall thickness (1.6mm)  with Rhino and set random z-seam alignment on Cura, which created this rough surface. <br>3. The double extrusion wall didn't stick together well - there was a space between the inner and outer layer. </p>

            <img src="images/a3-cylinder.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Cylinders</h3>
            <p>1. A cylinder 2cm in diameter exported with a 0.1mm tolerance (left) and 0.001mm tolerance (right) The one with 0.001mm tolerance looked better quality but there was no big difference between two. (35 mins for both)
            <br>
            2. I found there was a weird space between each layer. Would like to know how we can minimize these unwanted gaps.
            <br>
            3. A cylinder 2cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour". I don't know if was suppoed to look like this. (17 mins)
            
            </p>
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-support2.png" width=100%>
            <img src="images/a3-support.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Cylinder with support</h3>
            <p>I also created a cyinder 2cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on. I was able to see where it gets supports on Cura, wasn't sure if the support in the middle was necessary... The quality of cilynder was much better than the first 3 cylinders even though I used the same settings. (1 hour 37 mins)</p>
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/a3-nested2.png" width=100%>
            <img src="images/a3-nested.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Nested Object</h3>
            <p>Lastly, I printed nested opbjects. The hardest part of it was to create a 3d model with Rhino - it took me a while for me to create a triangle wall but I figured it out by using a command "PlanarSrf" and "ExtrudeSrf." It took 2 hours and 34 mins to print with standard quality.</p>
