            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The goal of this first assignment is to make a kit consisting of at least 30 instances of at least one unique part. The parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit and be laser cut out of cardboard. The fit should be such that the parts do not come apart with a light shaking.</p>
            
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Rhino, Illustrator, cardboard, laser cutter</p>

                <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                <p>I was inspired by the image of clovers that I came across during brainstorming. As 4-leaf clovers  represents good luck and are are hard to find, I decided to craft a press-fit construction kit with 25 pieces of 3-leaf clovers and 5 pieces of 4-leaf clovers.</p>

                <img src="images/a1-measurement.jpg">
                <h3>Take Measurements with Calipers</h3>
                <p>Measure the thickness of the cardboard (1.94mm) with calipers. Referring to this number, decide the width of a slot.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a1-sketch.jpg">
                <h3>Skteching</h3>
                <p>Sketch out some design ideas and decide the size of each dimention. Things to keep in mind: If slots are too deep, each piece would come in each other's way and they won't fit together. Making the corners of each slot slightly round is also helpful to make it easy to assemble.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>3D Modeling with Rhino</h3>
                <p>Referring to the sketch, create an outline of each design for the laser cutter. Some useful Rhino commands that I used were trim, join, fillet, align, explode, distance, Sel Dup, etc.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a1-test.jpg">
                <h3>Test Print</h3>
                <p>With the initial designs, test print 2 pieces to see if they fit well. I found the slots were too wide and shallow, and they didn't hold together well. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a1-3dmodel.png">
                <h3>Iterate & Final Design</h3>
                <p>I changed the width of the slot from 1.94 mm to 1.8 mm. Once the outline is finalized, I created 3D modeling. Commands that I used were extrudeCrv and cap.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a1-illustrator.png">
                <h3>Transfer to Illustrator</h3>
                <p>Once the design is finalized, export the Rhino file as an AI file. One important tip for this process is to select the right scale when exporting a Rhino file to Illustrator - input "1mm = 0.0394 inch" Then, open the Illustrator file and change the stroke of the outline to 0.01 pt. I did test print again to make sure the pieces fit together.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a1-lasercut.jpg">
                <h3>Laser Cut</h3>
                <p>Select "Print" from Illustrator, and adjust the setting as below. Since my cardboard was very thin (1.9mm) I set the speed relatively high to avoid burning the cardboard. I also adjusted the position of the laser cutter and run it without closing the lid to test it out first. *It doesn't pring the design that is out of the preview screen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed: 50%</li>
                    <li>Power: 80%</li>
                    <li>Freq: 50%</li>

                <img src="images/a1-parts.jpg">
                <h3>All the parts are ready</h3>
                <p>Carefully take all the pieces off the cardboard.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
