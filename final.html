            <h2>Idea Sketching</h2>
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a8-perspective.png">
                <h3>Idea sketching</h3>
                <p>The propagation station is going to look like stairs. Each little plate that holds a test tube will be a flower petal shape, and I'm going to lazer cut a acrylic sheet to create this shape. There are 6 flower petals and each petal holds one test tube. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
            <img src="images/a8-topbottom.png">
                <h3>Top & bottom view</h3>
                <p>When you see this propagation station from the top, it will look like a flower. The shape of the base is also going to be a flower shape as well. I I'm going to create it with a 3D printer.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <img src="images/a8-structure.png">
                <h3>How stem works</h3>
                <p>It is important to make sure that the stem is stable and the acrylic flower petals can hold test tubes filled with water without tilting. I decided to create Lego inspired round bricks to hold each acrylic plate tight.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <img src="images/final-prototype.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Hand cut cardboard & quick stem samples</h3>
            <p>Before modeling with Grasshopper, I wanted to create a lo-fi prototype to see if my idea actually works. I hand-cut a cardboard to make petals, quickly modeled the stem bricks with Rhino, and 3D-printed the stem brick. The test tubes I ordered were light enough so that the petal was able to hold it nicely. My first stem brick model also worked fine - it hold the cardboard and test tube without popping out, but </p>

            <img src="images/final-gh2.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Place all the circles</h3>
            <p>I created 4 circles, which will form the shape of a flower petal. (You can see the petal shape in the middle of this geometry.) I needed to make sure that the two small circles perfectly touch the large ciecles witout crossing each other. The measurements on the sketch was not very precice, so I had to scale the large circles down a little by little until they touch the small circles</p>

            <img src="images/final-gh3.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Trim and join</h3>
            <p>The next step is to trim the unnecessary lines off. Since I wasn't sure if there are ways to trim multiple lines with multiple regions, I ended up trimming one line at a time. The green lines are the first lines that I trimmed and the four lines highlighted in yellow are the lines that eventually formed the petal shape.</p>
            
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/final-gh4.png" width=100%>
            <div class="small-space-block"></div>
            <img src="images/final-gh5.png" width=100%>
            <h3>The outline is ready</h3>
            <p>Since the "Trim with Regions" feature only trims inside or outside of the object, I had to add a couple rectangles to only trim what I wanted to trim. (See the first image) Then, I successfully trimmed off all the unnecessary lines and joined the remaining lines to create the petal shape. Finally, I added two little circles to make holes in the petal (one hole holds a test tube and another holds a stem.) Now, the outline is ready for a laser cutting!</p>
            
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/final-laser.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Laser cut</h3>
            <p>I brought the AI file of the flower petal to the Mill to laser-cut them using acrylic sheets. I followed the material setting table at the Mill, chose vectore for job type, and set the speed (8), power (100), and Frequency (100). I was able to laser cut all the petals without any trouble.</p>
            
            <div class="space-block"></div>
            
            <img src="images/final-petalfinal.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Petals are ready</h3>
            <p>I laser cut total 12 petals using 4 different colors of acrylic sheets. I slightly changed the width of the hole that holds a test tube as I planned to create 2 different models (Diameter: 10mm and 9.8mm) You can see the hight of the tow test tubes in the picture is different.</p>
            
            <h2>Stem Design</h2>
            <img src="images/final-stemfails.png" width=100%>
            <h3>Troubleshoot</h3>
            <p>After I did the first test print, I was able to see the idea of adding a slot and tab worked. However, I ran into multiple problems and I ended up printing so many until I get the ones that perfectly fit with the flower petal.</p> <br>
            <p>One of the problems was that since the bricks didn't hold the petal tight enough, the petal was not horizontally straight. I had to adjust the depth of the hole in the brick. I also had a issue with the 3D printer - it didn't print the perfect round shape and the surface was very rough. I searched online and foudn that it was because the belt of X axis was loose. After tightening the best, it fixed both problems.</p>
