            <h2>Instruction</h2>
            <p>Modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL. You may use whatever STLs you want, e.g. downloaded from Thingiverse or elsewhere! When exporting the STL from Rhino, it should pass all checks for rapid prototyping.</p>
            
            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Rhino, Cura, Ender 3D Pro</p>

                <h3>Import STL files</h3>
                <p>I found this cute woody box on the internet during brainstorming and decided to create something similar.</p>

                <h3>Check the opject type</h3>
                <p>Sketched out to see what each aspect of the box would look like. Decide on the size of the box and each part. I kept the width of the box joints and slots the same first to see if they fit together.</p>

                <h3>Reduce mesh</h3>
                <p>Created a 3d model of each part with Rhino. The new command that I learned was Boolean Union, which merges two 3D objects into one. I was able to design the lid of the box with it. I used 0.01 tolerance when converting to stl file.</p>

                <h3>Combine 2 object</h3>
                <p>I test-printed two pieces with standard quality with Cora. I found that they didn’t fit together as the box joints were bigger than the slots although I make them the same width (5 mm)</p>

                <h3>Troubleshoot</h3>
                <p>I measured each part of the pieces with calipers. I found some parts were slightly larger than 5 mm while others were slightly smaller than 5 mm. I decided to make the width of slots 1mm larger and the width of box joints 1mm smaller on Rhino. I printed the same pieces and they fit well.</p>

                <h3>Check with Cura</h3>
                <p>For the lid design, I put 35mm square over 25mm square to make it fit tight in the box. It didn’t work when I tried printing it without any support (Image1), so I added support on Cura, which was an easy fix. The support came off very easily as well. (Images 2 & 3)</p>
